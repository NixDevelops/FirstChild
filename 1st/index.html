      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Hello, my name is <span class="up" id="name">Hussein Zeaiter also known as Nix <img src="https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=u3qbdsxjt" id="nix" alt="Nix at a peer"></span> and I'm a Web Developer, well...sorta. <br>
      This is my first personal Website ever that I created from scratch, all of the content as well as the design found were coded by my own hand, which is, on the contrary to stereotypes, really fun to do.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="purpose">
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>I built this website in order to practice and enhance what I have been studying for the past month. It's nowhere near <span class="hword" >"professional"</span> but rather works as a tool for me to determine my weakpoints. I try to include everything I studied as well as everything I researched on the internet in the mean time, which is mostly simple yet very confusing <span class="hword">(at first)</span> concepts of HTML5 and CSS3, and that is because this Website was only built on those two languages. It lacks both JavaScript and the key concepts of responsive design <span class="hword">(which means it looks "meh" on different screens )</span>, and if you're wondering why is that, well it's because I haven't started the rest of the courses still, and I started designing literally after completing my CSS3 course by 1min. <br> <hr>
      <span class="up">Anyways, to those who decide to continue adventuring through my simple work, I hope you enjoy your stay, and thank you for riding along in this journey, that just began.</span>
