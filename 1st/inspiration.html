      <h1>What Inspired Me ?</h1>
      <p>What inspired me to get into coding and change my career path from physiotherapy to computer science ? Well.... I genuinely don't remember the changing point that got me switching my entire life plan. As to what inspired me to create this website was personal websites done by actual <span class="hword">"professional"</span> web developers.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="brother">
      <h3>Older Brother</h3>
      <div class="hlder">
       <img src="https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=3g4r6qp6r" class="flip" id="car" alt="brother himself">
       <span  class="flip" id="cyber">He wouldn't send me a normal photo so I had to find a solution</span>
      </div> 
      <p>
        I somewhat do owe some of the inspiration to my older brother Tedz, as watching him code did give me a better view of what coding actually is apart from all of the scary math surrounding it. And to be honest, typing some stuff in a very complex theme and them magically appearing on the screen was most probably the changing point rofl.
      </p>

    <div id="web">
      <h3>Personalized Websites</h3>
      <iframe  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZqzhmlTkAc?start=1" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>
        Refering back to the <span class="hword">"professionals"</span> mentioned above, watching and researching their personal websites was definitely one of the main aspects that pushed me towards having my first practice project be a personal website. Although I lack the content to fill it in, thus why you have been reading very random things <span class="hword">Lol</span>, I still wanted to give it a try, as adding creativity and art to my work has always been a goal, and hopefully further along in my journey I'd have more meaningful content to layout in an actual professional portfolio. Anywho, this is one of the videos I watched, the websites shown are beyond amazing, enjoy.

      <h3>KillJoy</h3>
      <img src="https://files.fm/thumb_show.php?i=8tcj933xp" id="kj" alt="killjoy from valorant">
      <p>Now as to what inspired me to this certain color scheme was my main in Valorant, which is KillJoy. Although it's not that accurate, I found the combination of magenta, yellow, and cyan to work out perfectly especially when it came to popout hover effects. <br>
      Valorant is an fps game developed by the one and only Riot Games. It brings alot of cool and modern aspects to the table, and it sure has a sick website that you can check <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-us/" target="_blank" class="hword">here</a>.
